# ScureProd – Secure Production for Industry 4.0

🚀 **Industry 4.0 meets cybersecurity — real-time protection for smart factories**

---

## Overview

As industries evolve into the Fourth Industrial Revolution, they rely heavily on interconnected systems like IoT devices, PLCs, cloud platforms, and digital twins. This shift introduces advanced capabilities but also exposes critical operational technology (OT) to complex cyber threats.

**ScureProd** is an AI-powered SaaS platform designed to secure Industry 4.0 production environments by delivering non-intrusive, real-time threat detection and response—without disrupting operations.
